**What is ls?

This is the list command. It allows us... list the content of the directory.

`ls`

after running it we get on the screen is a list of the content of the current directory.

What is visible immediately, that we have different colors. We can imagine what it means, but let's forget it for a second. What many waves of "classic" sys admins saw in their days:

`ls --color=no`
